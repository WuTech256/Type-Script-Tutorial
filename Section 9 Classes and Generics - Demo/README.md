# Advanced TypeScript - Demo Project
    - Building a Linked List Data Structure
    - Work with Classes and Generics

## Understanding Linked Lists
    - A data structure that stores connected values

        Node 1 -> Node 2 -> Node 3
    - Every Node links to the Node next to it (but to no other Node in the overall list)
